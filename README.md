# My-First-token-with-Solidity
This simple token has a name, an abbreviation, and a total supply. It also has a mint function that helps credit addresses and a burn function that helps destroy tokens.

# Description
In this project, I created my first token with solidity. I used all I learned in the course on meta crafters including Datatypes, Functions, and mapping to come up with this token
