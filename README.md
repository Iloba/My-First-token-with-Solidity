# My-First-token-with-Solidity
This simple token has a name, an abbreviation, and a total supply. It also has a mint function that helps credit addresses and a burn function that helps destroy tokens.

# Description
This token was created with solidity. I used all I learned in the course on meta crafters (https://www.metacrafters.io/) including Datatypes, Functions, and mapping to develop this token.
